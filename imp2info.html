       <p>Exclusion
           A cyberbully can intentionally leave someone else out of an online group or message thread. This can leave a victim feeling isolated and depressed.
           
           
           Harassment-
           Harassment occurs when a cyberbully sends persistent and hurtful online messages to a victim. These messages can contain threats.
           
           
           Cyberstalking-
           With cyberstalking, a cyberbully monitors a victim’s online presence closely. The bully can also make false accusations and threats against the victim and their loved ones.
           
           
           Outing-
           A cyberbully outs a victim by openly revealing sensitive or personal information without their consent. The bully does so in the hopes of embarrassing or humiliating the victim.
           
           
           Frapping-
           Frapping occurs when a cyberbully uses a victim’s social media accounts to post inappropriate content with the victim’s name attached to it. In this scenario, the victim is tied to online content that can damage their reputation.
           
           
           Trolling-
           Not all trolling is considered cyberbullying, but cyberbullies can troll victims by posting derogatory comments about them online in the hopes of hurting these individuals.
           
           
           Dissing-
           A cyberbully disses a victim by spreading cruel information about them. The bully does so via public posts or private messages, with the intent of damaging the victim’s reputation or relationships with others.
           
           
           Denigration-
           A cyberbully denigrates a victim by sending, posting, or publishing false information online about the individual. Denigration usually consists of cruel rumors and gossip about a victim.
           
           
           Impersonation-
           A cyberbully can impersonate a victim by posting comments on social media and chat rooms in the individual’s name. Doing so can cause a victim to experience backlash from others based on the bully’s online comments.
           
           
           Trickery-
           A cyberbully can befriend a victim, to the point where the targeted individual feels comfortable sharing secrets and other sensitive information. The bully then publicly releases the information the victim shares to humiliate, shame, or otherwise harm them.
           
           
           Fake Profiles-
           Cyberbullies can set up fake online profiles on behalf of victims. They can use these profiles to publish false content in their victims’ names without the victims’ consent.
           
           
           Catfishing-
           With catfishing, a cyberbully exploits a victim’s emotions. A cyberbully attempting to catfish a victim creates a fake online identity and pretends to be someone else.  </p>
